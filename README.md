# PWABuilder VSCode extension

## Status: Alpha

Thanks for checking this project out, we are actively working on this extension so it may not work for you currently.

## Trying the Alpha
Once we are further along with this project we will be releasing to the [vscode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) so that this extension can be installed just like any other extension. Until then you can try the alpha with the following steps:

Prerequisites: You will need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on your machine.

- Run `git clone https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwabuilder-vscode-extension.git` in a directory of your choice
- In the directory we just cloned above (you should be in `/pwabuilder-vscode-extension`) run `npm install`
- Next, run `npm run build` in the same directory.
- Open the `/pwabuilder-vscode-extension` folder in [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and then press `F5` on your computer.
- This should open the extension in a new vscode window. Once it has opened you can press `ctrl + shift + P`and type `Start new Service Worker session`. 

If you have any problems with the above steps feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwabuilder-vscode-extension/issues) with us. Also, [these docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension) may help get you started.

Thanks,

PWABuilder Team
