# Contributing to the PWABuilder VSCode extension

PWABuilder was founded by Microsoft as a community guided, open source project to help move PWA adoption forward. We want to make sure that as the project evolves, it remains simple to get started, maintain, and improve.

Many of the guidelines of this document are focused on promoting this sustainable simplicity.

## Quick tech overview
The PWABuilder extension is built with the following tech stack:

- [lit-element](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/)
- [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) for building

It is helpful to be familiar with these technologies before contributing.

## Get started developing

### Prerequisites

At a minimum, you will need the following things properly installed on your computer to get started:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [NPM](http://npmjs.com/)

Beyond this, the PWABuilder VSCode extension is built using the standard best practices so the same development flow described in the [official docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension) can be followed.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Who can contribute?

Anyone who wants to be part of bringing PWAs to the web can contribute to PWABuilder! Skill level doesn't matter. All contributions big and small help us out. We have reviewers who can help you through the process the first few times.

## Why does Microsoft need contributors?

PWABuilder was founded by Microsoft, but it's only moved forward because of the community's help.  We open-sourced this because Microsoft wants to support the cross-platform development ecosystem and work with the community to direct the future of PWAs.

## What kind of contributions is PWABuilder seeking?

No contribution is too small or too big. Bigger tasks take longer to review while smaller ones get feedback more quickly. Most contributors start with a small update, a bug fix, or docs improvement, and then move on to bigger tasks as they gain more familiarity with PWABuilder.

## Where should I start contributing?

Check our [issues list](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwabuilder-vscode-extension/issues) and look for the "help wanted" label to find an issue to work on. Once you have found an issue you want to work on you can reply on that issue and someone from our team
will reach back out to you.

## What should I check before submitting a pull request?

For every contribution, you must:

* Test your code
* Target master branch (or an appropriate release branch if appropriate for a bug fix)
* Ensure that your contribution follows [standard accessibility guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/accessibility/design). Use tools like https://webhint.io/ to validate your changes.

If adding a new feature, 
    **you should open an issue with us** on the main PWABuilder repo on Github (https://github.com/pwa-builder/PWABuilder) before you start coding.

Once you have opened your PR, feel free to add a reviewer (Github should recommend people on the team). When the PR has been reviewed and is good to go, a team member will merge it.

## After my pull request gets merged, when does it become part of a PWABuilder release?
 
We will usually add fixes in the next planned release, but sometimes it makes sense to add a contribution in a later update to ensure the quality and performance of the next release.

## Found bugs?
If you find a bug, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](https://github.com/pwa-builder/PWABuilder/issues). Even better, you can
[submit a Pull Request](#pr) with a fix.

## Have other questions?
Please do not open issues for general support questions and keep our GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. There is a much better chance of getting your question answered on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pwabuilder) where questions should be tagged with `pwabuilder`
